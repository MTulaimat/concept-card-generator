An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Seven deadly sins
Barking up the wrong tree
A blessing in disguise
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Elephant in the room
Fight fire with fire
Ignorance is bliss
It takes two to tango
The ball is in your court
Let the cat out of the bag
Once in a blue moon
Spill the beans
Steal someone's thunder
Throw in the towel
Water under the bridge
Bite the bullet
Break the ice
Burning the midnight oil
Jumping on the bandwagon
Birds of a feather flock together
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Fortune favors the bold
Jack of all trades, master of none
Rome wasn't built in a day
The grass is always greener on the other side
You can’t have your cake and eat it too
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Too many cooks spoil the broth

The elephant in the room
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Burning bridges
Under the weather
A watched pot never boils
The last straw
Jumping to conclusions
Think outside the box

Magic trick
The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Chasing shadows.
Putting the pieces together.
History echoes through time.
The key to success is the right password.
If I could turn back time.
Now you see it, now you don't.
A magician never reveals his secrets.
What goes around comes around.
Andrew Tate
